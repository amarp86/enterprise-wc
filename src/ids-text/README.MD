# Ids Text Component

## Description

This component styles arbitrary text elements using the design guidelines.

## Use Cases

- When you need static text on a page
- When you need disabled appearing text in a page

## Terminology

- **Text**: A a human-readable sequence of character s and the words
- **Disabled**: Text can be disabled, this is usually done with some other element in mind. For example a disabled field label
- **Audible**: Text that does not appear in the page but is read by users with screen readers in order to give them information.

## Features (With Code Examples)

A normal text element used as a web component in size 16px.

```html
<ids-text font-size="16">Normal Text</ids-text>
```

A Disabled appearing text element.

```html
<ids-text disabled="true">Disabled Text</ids-text>
```

## Accessibility Guidelines

- 1.4.1 Use of Color - Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. Ensure the color tags that indicate state like OK, cancel, ect have other ways to indicate that information. This is failing.
- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) - The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.   Ensure the color tags pass contrast.

## Regional Considerations

Text should be localized in the current language. And should flip to the alternate side in Right To Left mode. Consider that in some languages text may be a lot longer (German). And in some cases it cant be wrapped (Thai).
